**How do I approach designing software?****
**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
I am now able to create 3D scenes that i was not familular with previously. I can also add lighting, textures, and scaled various elements in the scene. 

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
Most of my work on this project was small sections of the code and then test to make sure I am geeting the desired output. There was a lot of trial and error in this project. 

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
In the future I hope to work on developing videogames this course really helped give me the foundation and basics for being able to create the scenes in these games. 

**How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
Something that I tried new was to not wait until the tend to test to see if it world work. I broke each task into smaller section and completed those smaller sections and then tested to see of it was giving me what I was wanting. 

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
I honestly enjoyed the repitition. I really helped me understabd the code as a whole by the time I was finished with the last one. 

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
My approached evolved because I learned I needed more opportunities to test so I am not having to scrap everything that I did just to restart. I also learned that I needed to allocate more time to really focus and dive into the code to understand what is going on. 

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
I am completing a bachelors in computer science with a focus in software engineering. I will most likely be using the funstions and skills learned in this course to help me be successful in future classes. 

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
I want to develope software that will help others. This course has given me a background in creating visuals that may help in a future program of mine.
